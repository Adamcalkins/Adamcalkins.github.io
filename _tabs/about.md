▶️ I’m a 23‑year‑old from Katowice, Poland, currently in my fifth year of cybersecurity studies at Wrocław University of Science and Technology. I’ve already earned my engineering degree and now focus on red teaming—simulating attacks to uncover vulnerabilities before real adversaries do.

♦️ My main focus is red teaming: simulating attacks to help uncover hidden vulnerabilities before real adversaries find them. I thrive on the challenge of thinking like an attacker to strengthen the systems I test.

🚀 In my free time I collect perfumes and dive into PC games. Above all, I’m driven by an insatiable curiosity about the ever‑evolving world of cybersec. As I look ahead, I’m excited to apply my red‑teaming skills in a professional setting, contribute to open‑source security tools, and keep pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in digital defense. Stay tuned for what comes next!
